## Install

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

**📚 See**: [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md)

### Option 2: Build from Source

```

## Setup

**1. Auth (pick one):**

```bash
gh auth login                    # Use GitHub CLI (recommended)
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_xxx"    # Or set env var
```

**2. Config:**
Create `~/.prpilot_config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Track repos by topic (recommended)
mode: 'topics'
topics: ['backend', 'frontend']
topic_org: 'your-org'

# Filter out bot spam
exclude_bots: true
include_drafts: true
```

**📚 Detailed config options**: See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md)

## Config Modes

**📚 Full configuration guide**: [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md)

## 🐳 Docker Support

**📚 Docker usage**: [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md)

## Security

PR Pilot handles GitHub authentication tokens securely:

- ✅ **No token persistence by app** - PR Pilot never writes tokens to files or databases
- ✅ **External token management** - uses environment variables or GitHub CLI's secure storage
- ✅ **Minimal permissions** - requires only `repo` and `read:org` scopes
- ✅ **Secure API communication** - all requests use HTTPS with proper validation

**Token Security**: When using `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable, you are responsible for securing it in your shell configuration. GitHub CLI (`gh auth login`) is recommended as it manages tokens securely.

## Development

**📚 Development guide**: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

**CI/CD**: Linux testing, security scanning, Docker builds, automated releases.

**📚 Contributing**: See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
